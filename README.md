# Hi there 👋

I'm Sander and I love knowledge, I love learning about new stuff. Currently I'm studying sience and math at Campus Atheneum Keerbergen.  
In my free time I love doing sports, coding and learning new stuff. As main sport I do volleybal, in summer when the volleybal season ends I go to the gym.  
For those who want to know my bench pr is 70kg 😁.
